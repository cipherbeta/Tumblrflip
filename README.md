# Tumblrflip

A simple application used to flip through tumblr pictures. Can be used for screensavers, something to look at, etc.

## To develop

Clone the repository, and run `npm i` on that directory to install necessary dependencies. Make sure you have an [api key](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2) - put in the proper keys under `/src/helpers/keys.js` otherwise the app won't work. Run `npm start` to launch the app. The entire app is bootstrapped with CRA, so you can use the `react-scripts` tools to build/etc how you like.
